## Market Structure & Composition

### Sales vs. Rental Market Split

![Market Composition](charts/01_market_composition.png)

**What This Shows:**
The market is overwhelmingly oriented toward property sales (5,375 listings) compared to rentals (1,687 listings).

**Why This Matters:**
This 76-24 split reveals strong homeownership preference in the market. For investors and developers, this suggests:
- **Opportunity for rental market development** - The rental sector is underserved relative to demand
- **Sales infrastructure is mature** - Competition in sales requires differentiation
- **Build-to-sell remains dominant strategy** - Traditional development models still prevail

**Strategic Implications:**
Companies focusing on rental property development or property management services could capitalize on the less saturated rental segment, particularly with innovative offerings like flexible leases or corporate housing solutions.

## Property Size Distribution & Demand Patterns

### Room Count Analysis

![Property Size Distribution](charts/02_room_distribution.png)

**What This Shows:**
2-room and 3-room properties dominate the market with 2,221 and 2,392 listings respectively, representing 70% of all inventory.

**Why This Matters:**
This concentration reveals what buyers and sellers perceive as the market's sweet spot:
- **Young families and first-time buyers drive demand** - 2-3 rooms serve starter homes
- **Investment properties favor this range** - Optimal rental yield vs. investment ratio
- **Standardization in development** - Developers focus on proven demand

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Product Development**: New developments should prioritize 2-3 room units for fastest absorption
- **Inventory Risk**: Holdings outside this range require specialized marketing or pricing strategies
- **Market Entry**: First-time market entrants should focus on this segment for reduced risk

## Geographic Market Dynamics

### Regional Distribution in Baku

![Top Regions by Volume](charts/03_top_regions_volume.png)

**What This Shows:**
Three regions dominate Baku's market: Yasamal (947 listings), Nəsimi (891 listings), and Xətai (844 listings).

**Why This Matters:**
Geographic concentration indicates where market activity, infrastructure, and buyer attention are focused:
- **Liquidity is highest in top regions** - Easier to buy and sell
- **Market knowledge is deepest here** - Better comparable data for pricing
- **Competition for listings is intense** - Premium locations command attention

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Market Entry**: Yasamal, Nəsimi, and Xətai offer highest transaction velocity
- **Secondary Markets**: Sabunçu and other regions may offer better value for development
- **Portfolio Diversification**: Geographic spread reduces concentration risk

---

## Pricing Strategy & Regional Positioning

### Price Comparison Across Top Regions

![Regional Pricing](charts/04_regional_pricing.png)

**What This Shows:**
Səbail commands the highest median price (225K AZN), while Sabunçu offers the most affordable entry point (78K AZN). Notably, high-volume regions like Yasamal (175K) and Xətai (132K) show varied pricing.

**Why This Matters:**
**Volume doesn't equal premium pricing**. This disconnect creates distinct strategic opportunities:
- **Səbail**: Premium positioning, lower volume, luxury segment
- **Nərimanov & Nəsimi**: High prices with strong volume - stable, established markets
- **Xətai**: High volume but mid-range pricing - value segment with strong demand
- **Sabunçu**: Budget entry point - potential for affordable housing development

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Premium Developers**: Focus on Səbail and Nərimanov for luxury projects
- **Volume Players**: Yasamal and Nəsimi offer scale opportunities
- **Value Developers**: Sabunçu and Suraxanı present affordable housing potential
- **Investment Strategy**: Arbitrage opportunity exists between high-volume/mid-price regions

## Sales Market: Price Scaling by Property Size

### Property Size vs. Sale Price

![Sale Price by Rooms](charts/05_sale_price_by_rooms.png)

**What This Shows:**
Clear linear progression in pricing as property size increases: 1-room properties median at ~50K AZN, while 4-room properties reach ~165K AZN.

**Why This Matters:**
Predictable pricing curves indicate a rational, mature market:
- **Buyers understand value per room** - Market education is strong
- **Pricing transparency exists** - Limited information asymmetry
- **Room count is primary value driver** - Simple valuation models work

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Pricing Predictability**: Use room count as anchor for valuation models
- **Portfolio Planning**: Mix of sizes creates natural price point diversity
- **Marketing Focus**: Lead with room count in customer acquisition
- **Development Planning**: Room configuration drives return more than other features

## Rental Market Pricing Dynamics

### Monthly Rent by Property Size

![Rental Price by Rooms](charts/06_rental_price_by_rooms.png)

**What This Shows:**
Rental market shows interesting pricing: 2-room apartments rent for 650 AZN median, 3-room for 850 AZN, with a jump to 1,100 AZN for 4-room properties.

**Why This Matters:**
The rental market reveals affordability constraints and tenant priorities:
- **650-850 AZN is the sweet spot** - Largest tenant pool exists here
- **Sharp increase above 4 rooms** - Premium rental segment is distinct
- **2-3 room rental demand mirrors sales** - Consistent preference across market types

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Property Management**: Focus acquisition on 2-3 room units for stable occupancy
- **Rent Setting**: 650-850 AZN maximizes market reach
- **Corporate Housing**: 4+ room segment suitable for executive rentals
- **Yield Optimization**: Calculate ROI based on 2-3 room rental benchmarks

## Geographic Market Concentration

### City-Level Distribution

![Geographic Distribution](charts/07_geographic_distribution.png)

**What This Shows:**
Baku dominates with 80% market share (5,648 listings), followed distantly by Abşeron (897 listings, 13%) and Sumqayıt (143 listings, 2%).

**Why This Matters:**
Extreme concentration in Baku indicates where economic activity, jobs, and purchasing power reside:
- **Baku is the only true liquid market** - Deep buyer and seller pools
- **Secondary cities are thin** - Limited comparable transactions
- **Regional risk is high** - Outside Baku, exit strategies are constrained

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Primary Strategy**: Baku-focused approach reduces liquidity risk
- **Regional Play**: Abşeron offers scale outside Baku proper
- **Diversification Limits**: Geographic diversification beyond Baku adds significant complexity
- **Market Research**: Non-Baku markets require intensive local due diligence

---

## Financing Accessibility & Credit Market

### Credit Options Availability

![Credit Options](charts/08_credit_options.png)

**What This Shows:**
Only 20% of sale properties (1,085 out of 5,375) offer credit financing options.

**Why This Matters:**
Low credit availability creates both barriers and opportunities:
- **Cash market dominates** - Most transactions require full liquidity
- **Financing is differentiator** - Properties with credit options stand out
- **Barrier to entry for buyers** - Limits market to cash-rich purchasers
- **Untapped partnership potential** - Developer-bank collaboration could expand market

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Competitive Advantage**: Developers offering financing accelerate sales velocity
- **Market Expansion**: Credit options unlock new buyer segments
- **Bank Partnerships**: Co-marketing with financial institutions creates value
- **Pricing Power**: Finance availability can justify price premium
- **Risk Management**: Credit offering requires careful buyer screening

---

## Premium Features & Market Dynamics

### VIP, Premium Listings & Price Changes

![Premium Features](charts/09_premium_features.png)

**What This Shows:**
Extremely low adoption of premium features: VIP (22 listings, 0.3%), Premium (8 listings, 0.1%), and minimal price reductions (26 listings, 0.4%).

**Why This Matters:**
Low premium feature usage and minimal discounting suggests:
- **Stable pricing environment** - Sellers aren't desperate to move inventory
- **Limited platform monetization** - Listing platforms aren't capturing value through upgrades
- **Price discovery is efficient** - Properties listed at market-clearing prices
- **Seller confidence is high** - Minimal need for promotional tools

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Market Health**: Low discount rate indicates balanced supply-demand
- **Listing Platforms**: Opportunity to develop compelling premium offerings
- **Pricing Strategy**: Initial pricing should be market-accurate; discounting is rare
- **Inventory Velocity**: Properties that don't require discounts turn quickly

---

## Price Segmentation & Market Opportunities

### Distribution by Price Range

![Price Distribution](charts/10_price_distribution.png)

**What This Shows:**
The largest market segments are 100-150K AZN (1,340 properties, 24%) and 150-200K AZN (1,115 properties, 20%), with 200-300K AZN adding another 1,042 properties (19%).

**Why This Matters:**
The 100-300K AZN band represents **63% of the sales market**, defining where the majority of transactions occur:
- **Middle class purchasing power centers here** - This is the accessible homeownership band
- **Development economics favor this range** - Construction costs support profitable delivery
- **Largest buyer pool exists here** - Fastest absorption rates expected
- **Financial product availability** - Mortgages and financing structured for this segment

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Product Development**: Target 100-300K price points for maximum market reach
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Lower-risk profile due to deep demand
- **Competition**: Expect intense competition in this segment - differentiation required
- **Premium Positioning**: Properties above 300K need strong value proposition
- **Value Segment**: Sub-100K properties serve first-time buyers and investors

## Sales vs. Rental Market Comparison

### Property Size Preferences Across Market Types

![Sale vs Rent Comparison](charts/11_sale_vs_rent_rooms.png)

**What This Shows:**
Both sales and rental markets show strong preference for 2-3 room properties, with sales showing much higher absolute volume but similar proportional distribution.

**Why This Matters:**
**Demand patterns align across ownership types**, indicating:
- **Household size drives space needs** - Consistent across tenure types
- **Investment properties mirror end-user demand** - Investors target rentable configurations
- **Planning assumptions transfer** - Development for sale can convert to rental without demand mismatch
- **Market flexibility exists** - Developers can pivot between sale and rental exit strategies

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Development Flexibility**: Build 2-3 room units to preserve exit option flexibility
- **Investment Strategy**: Buy 2-3 room units for easiest resale or rental conversion
- **Market Cycle Hedging**: Property mix supports pivoting strategy based on market conditions
- **Standardization Benefits**: Operational efficiency from focused product types

## Regional Performance: Volume vs. Price Analysis

### Top 5 Regions Performance Matrix

![Regional Performance](charts/12_regional_performance.png)

**What This Shows:**
Yasamal leads in volume (947 listings) but Nərimanov commands higher median pricing (196K AZN vs. 175K AZN), while Xətai shows high volume but lower pricing (132K AZN).

**Why This Matters:**
**Volume and price premium don't always correlate**, revealing distinct strategic positions:
- **Yasamal**: High volume, strong pricing - competitive but proven market
- **Nərimanov**: Lower volume, highest pricing - selective, affluent buyers
- **Xətai**: High volume, value pricing - mass market opportunity
- **Nəsimi**: Balanced volume and pricing - stable, established market

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Premium Developers**: Nərimanov and Nəsimi offer price support with reasonable volume
- **Volume Strategy**: Yasamal and Xətai provide scale but different price positioning
- **Market Selection**: Choose based on business model (premium vs. volume vs. value)
- **Competitive Intensity**: High volume = high competition = need for differentiation
